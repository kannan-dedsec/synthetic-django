Module for handling Django signals in the project.

This module includes signal handlers for various events:
- Automatically generating and saving a slug for the `Article` model after it's saved.
- Cleaning up related resources before an `Article` instance is deleted.
- Handling changes to many-to-many relationships involving the `Article` model.
